This work imagines a near future where there is a people's government - that is, a government that works in the people's interests as a whole. It explores how this government would make decisions related to technology in one sector, agriculture. In doing so it points towards answers to two questions: (1) How can AI help in achieving the dream of a largely planned economy? and (2) What contradictions exist in such a society, and what role does technology play in resolving or furthering them? The work takes a dialectical view of technology and society. It uses the format of a Twitter feed, for familiarity and ease of understanding, and documents the goings-on in a national conference on agriculture and technology. It is accompanied by an essay for context.

The actors are an extension of an ongoing mapping that started out with the Revisualising Cybersecurity project, which shows the origin stories of dineshan. A manifestation of the intermingling of corporate and state interests around platforms and citizen/ user participation. This participation being rich sources of data extraction, referred to in many ways, most recently as ""Surveillance Capitalism"". These relationships are further explored in the comic ""dad and his invisibility mundu"" to illustrate what could happen when there is a rift between legality and justice when it comes to legislation around data and privacy. This mapping or extension develops different relationships between dineshan(s) and the people they want to know, keeping in mind the unfolding nature of automated decision-making systems and machine learning models used around the world, but specifically in India. The CCTV’d ones leaning heavily towards private and/or corporate interests represented without the crown, the ones with crowns are state bodies, often constituted by an electoral process directly or indirectly. The colour red is used often to indicate something that manifests in a tangible form: subject/citizens of a state, infrastructure that allows for participation/ interaction. The colour blue is usually an indicator of aggregated data and datasets that have been compressed or processed through manual moderation, paperwork and supervised/ unsupervised learning models. A mix of red, blue and yellow indicates an extraction of behaviour that has been quantified in one or more ways, often under the label of ""raw data\'\'. Though while drawing these, rawness points more towards a metaphor for vegetables and uncooked-ness as opposed to referring to data as oil, from crude to pure. Green is usually an indicator of learnt (choice-probability based) abstraction that is part of a learning model that recognises human behaviours, through translation and matching depending on the task that is being automated. Typologies for images for facial recognition, or numbers and text for welfare, license plate id\'ng. There is only one black box in the scheme of the illustration, it refers only to the environment in which either program are written or where they\'re parsed. In a mythical landscape of dineshans it is easier to assume transparency to non-anthropomorphised ADMS instead of allowing the persistence of dystopian blackboxes (usually a flowchart mnemonic) which pushes human agency from hope into despair. Which cannot be the consequence of mapping complex things. Dineshan is the only CCTV’d anthropomorph, as they are a result of human agency directed one way or subverted in another. The map underscores the importance of the territory, as does a learning model the importance of knowing contextually the lived experiences of people, that can only be categorised and generalised to a limit, linked data is not the map of a person’s unique identity.

A precedent for such possibilities was already set when all digital portals in India were recently announced to have come under the purview of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The department suggested the use of automated decision-making in separating out “lawful” and “unlawful” content. A future was thus dreamt to flip the present on its own head, where ADM educates rather than censors. Consequently, a few of the most commonly observed phobias, propaganda, and -isms have been selected and reviewed alongside corresponding findings and statistics.
