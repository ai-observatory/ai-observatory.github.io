    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      This project was provoked by the marked difference between the progressive
      and hyperbolic discourse on how digital technologies and &lsquo;Artificial
      Intelligence&rsquo; could solve complex problems in governance, and the
      experiences of the people using and being affected by these technologies
      in practice. This is an attempt to both critically analyse the claims of
      AI and Automated Decision Making Systems used in consequential areas, as
      well as inspire greater interrogation of, and participation in,
      conversations about how these systems should be developed and
      governed.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;AI Observatory&rsquo;, is intended to be a participatory
      effort, to be built upon by individuals and communities impacted by ADMS
      in India. It is intended to serve as a larger effort of counter-mapping
      and interrogating the opaque and unaccountable ways in which these systems
      are deployed and used within government institutions in India.&nbsp;

    <p>
      Please email me at divij [dot] joshi [at] gmail.com if you have a story or
      experience about your interaction with ADMS in India, or if you have
      resources and documentation to add to the observatory.
