    <p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence or &lsquo;AI&rsquo; has no legal or standard
      definition. It usually refers to the use of computational systems in a
      context where their performance is considered as displaying intelligence
      and agency normally attributed to people.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;AI&rsquo; nowadays often refers to Machine Learning systems, which
      use data to make predictions and classifications.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Algorithm</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      An algorithm refers to a series of steps to convert a particular input
      into a specified output. For the purpose of this resource,
      &lsquo;algorithms&rsquo; are the instructions or logic which is used by a
      computer to perform a specific task.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Within many Automated Decision-Making Systems, the algorithm is part of
      the specific software or computer programme used to process information
      from a database and generate a &lsquo;classification&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term &lsquo;algorithm&rsquo; here is often invoked to refer to a wider
      practice of making decisions and producing knowledge through the use of
      computational systems, which requires information about people and things
      to be converted into computational data, and which formalises social
      phenomenon as mathematical or quantifiable problems which can be solved
      through effective computation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Example</em></strong>: Facial Recognition Technology used by the Delhi
      Police utilises a machine learning algorithm, to create a digital
      &lsquo;copy&rsquo; of a person&rsquo;s face and find a match within police
      databases.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Automated Decision-Making Systems</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      An Automated Decision-Making System (ADMS) here refers to any system which
      uses computational and algorithmic tools to automatically process
      information and generate a decision which is of consequence to an
      individual or a community.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      ADMS use algorithms to automatically process information in different
      ways, but it is a broader term than &lsquo;algorithm&rsquo;, which also
      capture the underlying technologies and computing infrastructures, as well
      as the human processes and the specific context in which algorithms are
      used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: The Government of Telangana&rsquo;s &lsquo;Samagra Vedika&rsquo;
      system uses data analysis to place people in categories for the purpose of
      allocating welfare resources. This analysis informs the decisions of the
      Government for the purpose of welfare administration.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Big Data</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Big Data generally refers to the use of computational analytics to find
      patterns among large and diverse sets of data.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Biometric Data</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Biometric data refers to data which measure biological human
      characteristics, such as fingerprints, genetic information, gait, blood
      type, or facial maps in facial recognition technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: Fingerprints and iris scans used in the Aadhaar system are
      examples of biometric data, which is captured and stored in a digital
      form.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Bias</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      In statistics and machine learning, bias is the systematic preference that
      a particular algorithm displays for some kinds of outputs over others.
      There are multiple sources of biases in algorithms and ADMS.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the context in which it is deployed, biases in algorithmic
      systems can lead to harmful or illegal forms of discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: If a targeted advertising algorithm consistently prefers to show
      higher-earning job opportunities to men over women (with all else being
      equal), the system can be said to be biased in favour of men.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Data</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Data is an abstraction of any real world phenomenon into a fixed and
      usable format which can be read by humans or by computers, as digital
      data.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Database</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      A database is an organisation of data points in a usable manner,
      particularly of digital data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: The Centralised Identities Data Repository is a digital database
      of all biometric information collected within the Aadhaar system.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Data Protection&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Data protection refers to various practices and efforts towards ensuring
      individual or collective control over forms of data to prevent
      misuse.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Discrimination</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      In law, discrimination is the systematic unfair or unequal treatment of an
      individual or a community based on certain attributes like caste, race,
      class, gender or sex, and unrelated to a legitimate objective.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: The refusal to provide government services, or entry into a
      public house or establishment, on the basis of religion, caste or race is
      a form of discrimination prohibited by the Constitution of India.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Due Process</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Due Process is a procedural threshold which must be satisfied when a
      government agency makes any consequential decision about an individual.
      The procedural elements of due process vary across contexts, but generally
      include the right to notice, the right to a hearing, the right to present
      countervailing evidence, and the right to an appeal.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Privacy, Right to</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      The Right to Privacy is a fundamental right protected under Part III of
      the Constitution of India. The Right to Privacy was explicitly affirmed by
      a 9-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in
      <em>KS Puttaswamy v Union of India. </em>Privacy over information is
      closely related to data protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: You have a right to privacy in personal communications, which
      means that governments cannot spy on your personal communications without
      legitimate reasons and only within specific exceptions and
      limitations.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Machine Learning</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Machine Learning is a property whereby an algorithm&rsquo;s performance in
      a defined output improves with &lsquo;experience&rsquo; in the form of
      more data or more computational power. Machine learning systems are
      computerised algorithmic systems, which can produce a particular output
      without explicitly being programmed to do so by a human.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Machine learning is widely considered a form of Artificial Intelligence,
      and is used to make predictions and classifications about human behaviour
      and phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: The Income Tax Department uses Machine Learning to classify
      potential instances of tax fraud&rsquo; based on historical examples of
      &lsquo;fraudulent behaviour&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Profiling</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Profiling refers to the process of using algorithmic systems to sort
      individuals into certain classifications or categories, or to predict
      attributes which were not disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: Policing agencies use algorithms deployed on social media to link
      individuals to &lsquo;potential criminal associates&rsquo;. Inferring
      possible criminal associations through social media behaviour is an
      example of &lsquo;profiling&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Classification</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Classification is an algorithmic process by which input data is processed
      and sorted into different categories or classes according to the function
      of the algorithm.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Source Code</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Source Code is the written description which specifies the actions
      performed by a computer programme.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Equality, Right to</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      The Right to Equality is a fundamental right under the Constitution of
      India. It requires the State to provide equal protection of the law to
      every person, and prohibits discrimination on certain protected grounds.
      It also protects against arbitrary and unreasonable government action,
      particularly in the creation of unreasonable and irrational
      classifications used to discriminate against people.&nbsp;
