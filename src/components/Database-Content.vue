    <h1>All Data, Big and Small</h1>
    <p>Automated Decision-Making Systems rely on technologies which perform computational algorithmic operations on data organised within databases. It is crucial to understand the technological architecture of ADMS systems in India, in order to understand the harms these systems pose and how they may be challenged.</p>
    <p>Data is the basic unit for the operation of an ADMS system. Databases are organisations of discrete data points, generally to indicate relationships between different data points and values. While databases in various forms have been created and utilised in the past for informing decision making, contemporary networked technologies and digitisation have radically changed the ability to create, process and communicate data, and to establish links between them for the purpose of organising them within databases and for performing computational operations on such databases.</p>
    <p>Policies on AI and information technology in India emphasise the need to collect and process ‘raw data’ as an elemental resource capable of further transformation into intelligence or insight, or a crucial factor in the production of ‘Artificial Intelligence’, particularly within ADMS. However, ‘raw data’ is always an oxymoron, and it is necessary to interrogate what ‘raw’ data actually represents, and what must be accounted for in its analysis and use by various actors. The measurement, classification and categorisation of any phenomenon into ‘data’ which is usable and readable by humans and/or machines, is a task of interpretation which always incorporates on human judgements, subjectivities and biases. It is therefore necessary to examine, and in some cases challenge, the assumptions and subjectivity of the ‘raw data’ used within computational systems and AI systems, for what kinds of knowledge about individuals and groups they reflect, and what effects the automated processing of such data within an ADMS may have.</p>
    <p>To understand how ADMS in India are functioning, it is important to look at the forms of data being collected and processed, as well as the methods of databasing being utilised, which form the underlying elements of any such system.</p>
    <p>The ADMS documented in this project reflect a number of diverse databases and databasing practices being used. Some of these demonstrate clear historical antecedents – such as the various crime and criminal databases at state and central levels. Others databases demonstrate techniques of databasing which are specific to newer technologies of data capture and analysis – such as real-time sentiment analysis on social media, or analytics used in facial recognition systems.</p>
    <p>The databasing practices of public agencies in India (including how data is collected, stored and communicated) have long historical lineages, with data on populations being routinely collected through surveys and censuses and collected in databases like the Census of India, or through police station registries – much of which remains paper-based and reliant on manual entry. More recent digital databases include the Ministry of Road Transport’s VAHAN database of vehicle registrations, or Karnataka’s Bhoomi database of digitised land records.</p>
    <p>Increasingly, the kinds of data that are collected, and the manner in which they are organised are being informed by ADMS, Big Data and AI. For example, there is an increasing use of automated tools for the purpose of databasing – technologies which allow for data to be captured and added to databases without human involvement. Similarly, public agencies are using internet-enabled sensors within various Smart City projects to monitor traffic or environmental conditions, as well as online ‘social media monitoring systems’ which detect and index information programmatically – therefore, even the choice of what data is collected is delegated in various degrees to algorithms.</p>
    <p>Digitisation has allowed for increasing amounts of ‘data’ to be created and stored in a centralised manner, allowing agencies to both easily generate, record and retrieve information from large databases. This has been a major achievement of e-Governance policies and reforms over the last two decades particularly, with extensive computerisation of government agencies, including the computerisation of data which the state collects about citizens. However, many of these databases carry forward legacies of inequities and injustice, often obscuring them by treating them as ‘raw data’ or by formalising and entrenching them as standard categories and classifications.</p>

    <p>Digital databases also afford ‘linkability’. Linkability is a feature of digital databases which provides a relationship two or more records with the same data subject to be, for the purpose of querying or for performing operations across multiple disparate databases. There is an increasing propensity within the management of databases by public agencies in India, to merge or provide linkages across databases which existed as stand-alone silos. Linkability was a core function of the Aadhar’s Unique Identification Number. By ‘seeding’ an Aadhaar number into a pre-existing database, the supposedly ‘unique’ database of UID numbers was linked to existing databases, which could create a unique profile of an individual’s links to various databases, and was also used to verify that each data entry was unique. </p>
    <p>Similarly, various databases have been digitised and ‘linked’ to remove duplicates, even in the absence of Aadhaar seeding – for example, the Government of India’s subsidy scheme for cooking gas – “Ujjwala”, utilises multiple underlying databases including those provided by cooking gas utilities, and the state’s own databases of ‘Below Poverty Line’ residents.</p>
