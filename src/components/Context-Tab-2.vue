  <b-tab title="Data and Databases in Automated Decision-Making in India">
    <p>
      Automated Decision-Making Systems utilise technologies which perform
      computational algorithmic operations on data organised within databases.
      It is crucial to understand the technological architecture of ADMS systems
      in India, in order to understand the harms these systems pose and how they
      may be challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data is the basic unit for the operation of an ADMS system. Databases are
      organisations of discrete data points, generally to indicate relationships
      between different data points and values. While databases in various forms
      have been created and utilised in the past for informing decision making,
      contemporary networked technologies and digitisation have radically
      changed the ability to create, process and communicate data.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology policy in India has emphasised the need to collect and process
      &lsquo;<em>raw data&rsquo;</em> as an elemental resource capable of
      further transformation into <em>intelligence</em> or <em>insight, </em>or
      a crucial factor in the production of &lsquo;Artificial
      Intelligence&rsquo;. However, &ldquo;&lsquo;raw data&rsquo; is an
      oxymoron&rdquo;, and it is necessary to interrogate what &lsquo;raw&rsquo;
      data actually represents. The measurement, classification and
      categorisation of any phenomenon into &lsquo;data&rsquo; and datasets,
      which is usable and readable by humans and/or machines, is a task of
      interpretation which always incorporates human judgements, subjectivities
      and biases. The selection of data for collection and aggregation, to the
      categories the data is grouped into, and how these categories are
      ultimately perceived for the purpose of making &lsquo;data based
      decisions&rsquo;, reveal the subjectivities inherent in the data that is
      used within ADMS.&nbsp;

    <p>
      It is therefore necessary to examine, and reflect upon the assumptions and
      subjectivity of the &lsquo;raw data&rsquo; used within computational
      systems and AI systems, for what kinds of knowledge about individuals and
      groups they reflect, and what the implication of relying upon such data
      within ADMS might be. To understand how ADMS in India are functioning, it
      is important to look at the forms of data being collected and processed,
      as well as the methods of databasing being utilised, which form the
      underlying elements of any such system.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The databasing practices of public agencies in India (including how, and
      which, data is collected, stored and structured) have long historical
      lineages, with data on populations being routinely collected through
      surveys and censuses and collected in databases like the Census of India,
      or through police station registries &ndash; much of which remains
      paper-based and reliant on manual entry. More recently, digitisation has
      resulted in an astonishing number of sources from which data can be
      obtained. Digital databases include the Ministry of Road Transport&rsquo;s
      VAHAN database of vehicle registrations, or Karnataka&rsquo;s Bhoomi
      database of digitised land records, as well as any number of records which
      enumerate citizens and their relationship with the state - from
      electricity bills to housing registries. Each of these digital databases
      are suitable for wide-scale use to store and retrieve information with
      ease.&nbsp;

    <p>
      The ADMS documented in this project reflect a number of diverse databases
      and databasing practices being used. Some of these demonstrate clear
      historical antecedents &ndash; such as the various crime and criminal
      databases at state and central levels. Other databases demonstrate
      techniques of databasing which are specific to newer technologies of data
      capture and analysis &ndash; such as real-time sentiment analysis on
      social media, or analytics used in facial recognition systems.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Increasingly, the kinds of data that are collected, and the manner in
      which they are organised are being informed by ADMS, Big Data and AI.
      Public agencies are progressively using automated tools for the purpose of
      capturing and storing data within databases. Technologies like
      &lsquo;sentiment analysis&rsquo;, or social media surveillance
      technologies, crawl through vast amounts of data on the internet, and only
      capture and store specific information as determined by the software, and
      without specific human involvement in each instance. Similarly, public
      agencies are using internet-enabled sensors within various Smart City
      projects to monitor traffic or environmental conditions to detect and
      index information programmatically. These technologies are intended to
      automatically sense and organise particular patterns of data - therefore
      delegating the task of data selection itself to algorithmic systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digitisation has allowed for increasing amounts of &lsquo;data&rsquo; to
      be created and stored in a centralised manner, allowing agencies to both
      easily generate, record and retrieve information from large databases.
      This has been a major achievement of e-Governance policies and reforms
      over the last two decades particularly, with extensive computerisation of
      government agencies, including the computerisation of data which the state
      collects about citizens. However, many of these databases carry forward
      historical legacies of inequities and injustice, often obscuring them by
      treating them as &lsquo;raw data&rsquo; or by formalising and entrenching
      them as standard categories and classifications.

              The system intends to &lsquo;connect&rsquo; the millions of police

              central to the work of law enforcement agencies in India. CCTNS
              includes data from &lsquo;real time&rsquo; sources like sensors,

              legacy of historical caste and ethnic discrimination in policing
              in India. In many states, the practices of criminal databasing
              have clear historical lineages with the colonial practice of
              surveilling and criminalising entire castes and tribes, the
              so-called &lsquo;criminal tribes&rsquo; which were categorised as
              tribes &lsquo;habitually addicted to crime&rsquo;. This
              unscientific and deeply prejudiced system of classification
              continues to shape policing practice in India. Despite the
              official &lsquo;denotification&rsquo; of criminal tribes, the
              biases and prejudices of criminality associated with such castes
              continue within contemporary policing practices, including in the
              maintenance of routine police records, such as the Rowdy Register
              maintained by the Tamil Nadu police under its implementation of
              the CCTNS, the Goonda Registers maintained in the Bihar CCTNS, or
              &lsquo;History Sheeters&rsquo; registers maintained in Karnataka.
              Each of these carry forward explicit continuities with the
              casteist and racial practices of surveilling and punishing
              &lsquo;criminal tribes&rsquo; and institutionally embedding
              discrimination, including through the technologies of digital

    <p>
      Digital databases need to be organised and structured in particular ways,
      in order to be usable. This process of structuring databases, classifying
      the data and identifying the relationships between the data values, is
      known as data modelling. Many contemporary digital databases are being
      built as &lsquo;relational databases&rsquo;, which is a particular model
      for structuring and retrieving data. Relational Database Management
      Systems or RDBMS afford for discrete databases to be linked and
      information to be retrieved across these databases. RDBMS allows databases
      to be linked through identifying relationships between two or more records
      with common features. Common elements in databases can therefore be linked
      for the purpose of querying or for performing operations across multiple
      disparate databases. More recently, database models like NoSQL are being
      utilised to deal with unstructured forms of data, particularly
      &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; data retrieved from the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public agencies in India are progressively seeking to merge or create
      linkages across databases which earlier existed in silos. Linking
      disparate databases has been a major use of the Unique Identification
      Number project in India, which has utilised large relational database
      solutions including &lsquo;MongoDB&rsquo; and &lsquo;MySQL&rsquo; to store
      and retrieve the data of more than a billion Indians. By
      &lsquo;seeding&rsquo; an Aadhaar number into a pre-existing database, the
      supposedly unique database of UID numbers was linked to existing
      databases. This was done not only to create a unique profile of an
      individual, through their links with various databases, but also to
      identify that each entry within a database of individuals was unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />Similarly, various databases have been digitised and
      &lsquo;linked&rsquo; to remove duplicates, even in the absence of Aadhaar
      seeding &ndash; for example, the Government of India&rsquo;s subsidy
      scheme for cooking gas, &ldquo;Ujjwala&rdquo;, utilises multiple
      underlying databases including those provided by cooking gas utilities,
      and the state&rsquo;s own databases of &lsquo;Below Poverty Line&rsquo;
      residents, to identify similar beneficiaries in the databases. Similar
      projects for creating relations between pre-existing databases abound
      within administrative and governance projects. In doing so, ADMS also rely
      on data collected across contexts and across various social relationships
      that individuals may have, which are collapsed into a single identity for
      the purpose of seeing the citizen. These identities then become the basis
      for performing algorithmic operations, and ultimately, the basis for
      administrative decisions.

              unprecedented exercise of collecting household statistical data
              across the state, as part of its &lsquo;Samagra Kutumba&rsquo;
              Intensive Household Survey. Extensive personal information was
              collected &ndash; from assets to health information about
              individuals in the state.</strong

            <strong
              >Subsequently, the Samagra Kutumba survey has morphed into the
              Samagra Vedika programme (alternatively known as the Samagra
              Telangana Smart Governance Platform) &ndash; a databasing system
              which allows for the querying of data across 30 Government
              databases, including utility, land, and vehicle registration
              databases. According to the Government of Telangana, utilising
              data across multiple databases has allowed them to create a
              &lsquo;360 Degree Profile&rsquo; of citizens, which has been
              praised by the Government of India (which has attempted to emulate
              the practice through the creation of a National Social Registry -
              a combination of public databases).</strong

              These databases are held within government administrations, with
              citizens themselves given no notification of whether they are
